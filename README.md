Problem:
There is no unified automation layer that seamlessly connects CRM, marketing, communication, and billing tools in a context-aware and dynamic way.
Businesses either hard-code integrations or depend on brittle no-code workflows that lack intelligence, observability, and adaptability.
Opportunity:
Using Composio’s Tool Router, we can orchestrate these disparate SaaS tools under one dynamic API layer — allowing an AI agent or automation logic to discover, authenticate, and execute multi-app workflows intelligently.
