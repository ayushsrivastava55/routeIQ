**üß© Problem Statement (PS)**
=============================

### **Title:**

**Intelligent Lead-to-Revenue Automation System using Composio Tool Router**

### **Background:**

Sales and marketing teams spend a significant portion of their time on repetitive manual work ‚Äî capturing leads from multiple channels, enriching and qualifying them, routing to the right sales reps, and managing campaign follow-ups.

Despite having modern CRMs and email tools, data silos and disjointed workflows lead to:

*   Slow lead response times
    
*   Missed follow-ups
    
*   Inefficient sales routing
    
*   Poor visibility into campaign ROI
    

### **Problem:**

There is no unified automation layer that seamlessly connects¬†**CRM**,¬†**marketing**,¬†**communication**, and¬†**billing**¬†tools in a context-aware and dynamic way.

Businesses either hard-code integrations or depend on brittle no-code workflows that lack intelligence, observability, and adaptability.

### **Opportunity:**

Using¬†**Composio‚Äôs Tool Router**, we can orchestrate these disparate SaaS tools under one dynamic API layer ‚Äî allowing an AI agent or automation logic to discover, authenticate, and execute multi-app workflows intelligently.
